# About

[coolLabs fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io) is a privacy-friendly drop-in replacement for Google Fonts.

You can use it for free to add fonts to your side. It will be totally free forever.

## Who is it for?
For everyone who have privacy issues with Google Fonts, and do not want their users to be used as data, while surfing your websites / applications.

## Why it exists?
To have a choice for a privacy focused, but still developer friendly font library.

## Why it is free?
I'm using [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net/) to serve all the fonts, close to your users and it costs me around $1/month, so technically, for me it's not free.

## How it is privacy focused?
- All the application code is open sourced.
- BunnyCDN has an option to completely disable logging.
- Hosted on a bare metal server, not on a cloud provider.   

## Who's idea was this?
It was [mine](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai). I'm building it with my community over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/6rDM4fkymF)/[Github](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify). If you are interested, come join and let's have a talk. :)
