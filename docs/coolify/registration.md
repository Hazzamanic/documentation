# Registration

After installation, the first registered user will be the `root / admin` user of your Coolify instance. It will see / change all resources deployed, access system wide configurations, one-click update process etc.

> By default, **registration is disabled** afterwards. You can enable registration in the `Settings` menu.

Every other user won't access to system wide configurations and only see their team's resources.

## Type of authentication
Currently only email/password registration is supported.
