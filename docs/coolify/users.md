# Users

The first registered user will be the `admin` user of the Coolify instance. Every other users won't access to system wide configurations, such as settings related to the instance, one-click update, etc.. 

With the first registration, a `root team` is created as well. You can add other users to this team to have admin privileges over your Coolify instance.

By default, registration is disabled after the first user is created. You can enable registration in the `Settings` menu.
