# Git Sources

Git Sources defines where your application's source code is located.

These sources are used to:
- Setup helper apps (such as GitHub App, GitLab App) at your Git providers,
- Provides access through tokens to your repositories,
- Clone your application's code,
- Setup webhooks for automated deployments,
- etc..

## Types
Hosted or self-hosted versions of the following Git providers are supported:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket (WIP)
- Gitea (WIP)

## Features
All commits are autodeployed through webhooks. You just need to write and push the code - everything else handled by Coolify.
