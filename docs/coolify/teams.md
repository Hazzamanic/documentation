# Teams
Each registered user has its team automatically. Each team only has access to its own resources. 

You can register any number of teams and invite any number of users to it.

## Privileges
Team members could have two kinds of privileges:

- `admin` has the same privileges as the `owner` of the team.
- `read` can only read things.

## Root Team
With the first user, a `root team` is also created. Users in this team have the same privileges as the first user so that they can access system-wide configurations, etc.
