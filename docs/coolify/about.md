# About

[Coolify](https://coolify.io) is a self-hostable all-in-one solution to host your applications, databases or other open-source services.

It's an alternative software to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other alternatives out there.

#### [Live demo](https://demo.coolify.io/)

## Who is it for?
For everyone who would not like to rely on huge cloud providers for any reasons, or teams/companies/enterprises who cannot host on those cloud platforms due to security or other reasons. Or for anyone who like cool software.

## Why it exists?
It started because I was curious if I could write it. And this happened. 

## Who's idea was this?
It was [mine](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai). I'm building it with my community over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/6rDM4fkymF)/[Github](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify). If you are interested, come join and let's have a talk.
