# About

[Coolify](https://coolify.io) is a self-hostable all-in-one solution to host your applications, databases or other open-source services.

It's an alternative software to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other alternatives out there.

Built by [on guy](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai) and his community over Discord & GitHub.

## Who is it for?
For everyone who would not like to rely on huge cloud providers for any reasons, or teams/companies/enterprises who cannot host on those cloud platforms due to security or other reasons. Or for anyone who like cool software.

## Why it exists?
It started because I was curious if I could write it. And this happened.
