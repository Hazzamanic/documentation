## Feedback
If you have a new service / build pack you would like to add, raise an idea [here](https://feedback.coolify.io/) to get feedback from the community!

## Who is it for?
1. Hobbyists to quickly run your applications and ship that MVP!
2. Companies and teams who would like to host their resources in-house.
3. For everyone who would not like to rely on huge cloud providers for any reason.
4. Or for anyone who likes cool software.

## Why does it exists?
It started because I was curious if I could write it. And this happened.

I use it for all my applications, and since its launch, more and more people and companies have started to use it for their job!

## Who's idea was this?
It was [mine](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai). I'm building it with my community over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrasbacsai)/[Discord](https://discord.gg/6rDM4fkymF)/[Github](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify). If you are interested, come join and let's talk. :)
