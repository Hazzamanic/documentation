# User & Team Management

Coolify has a simple identity management. 

Users can register (if enabled) and each user could create teams. Users invited to a team could have `admin` or `read` access.

- `admin` has the same privileges as the `owner` of the team.
- `read` can only read things - obviously.

## Registration 
The first registered user will be the `admin` user of the Coolify instance. Every other users won't access to system wide configurations, such as Coolify settings, one-click update, etc.. 

> By default, **registration is disabled** after the first user is created. 
> 
> You can enable registration in the `Settings` menu.

## Root Team

With the first user, a `root team` is also created. Users in this team have the same privileges as the first user.
